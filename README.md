# Creating a Mobile-Only Clicker Game for Acme Inc.

## Duration

2.5 hours

## Objective

In this exercise, we will develop a mobile-only clicker game for Acme Inc., designed to promote their innovative new product, "Hand Crank+." Participants will dive into HTML DOM manipulation, CSS Media Queries, Mobile-First Development, and JavaScript Event Listeners while ensuring the game is exclusively available on mobile devices and providing a desktop message directing users to visit on mobile.

## Materials Needed

- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome)

## Scenario

Acme Inc., a pioneering company known for its inventive products, is gearing up to launch "Hand Crank+," a unique device. To generate excitement and interest, Acme urgently requires an interactive and responsive clicker game that is exclusively available on mobile devices.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Setting Up the Project (30 minutes)

1. Create a new project folder on your computer, focusing on efficiency.
2. Inside the project folder, promptly create the following files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
3. Establish the essential structure of your HTML document in `index.html`, including a title and an element where the game will be displayed.

### Part 2: Designing the Mobile-Only Layout (30 minutes)

4. Using HTML and CSS, design a mobile-exclusive clicker game for Acme Inc., focusing on simplicity and user engagement.
5. Implement responsive styling to ensure the game looks appealing on mobile devices.

### Part 3: Adding Game Functionality (45 minutes)

6. In `script.js`, create JavaScript functions to handle game logic, such as incrementing the click count when the hand crank is clicked.
7. Implement event listeners to track user clicks and update the game interface accordingly.
8. Display the click count and any relevant game information in the DOM.

### Part 4: Displaying Desktop Message (30 minutes)

9. Use CSS media queries to detect desktop devices with larger screens.
10. If a desktop device is detected, display a message on the webpage informing users that they need to visit the site on a mobile device to participate in the game.

### Part 5: Optional Enhancements (30 minutes)

11. If time allows, consider adding extra features to make the game more engaging, like achievements, animations, or sound effects.
12. Thoroughly test these enhancements to ensure they contribute positively to the mobile clicker game.

### Part 6: Final Testing and Documentation (20 minutes)

13. Test your project on various mobile devices to guarantee full responsiveness.
14. Document your code with explanatory comments for clarity.
15. Create a README file with instructions on how to play the mobile-only clicker game and details about any optional features.

### Part 7: Discussion in the Next Lesson

16. Plan to hold a discussion in the next lesson to encourage participants to share their experiences and insights.
17. Discuss the challenges faced, innovative solutions discovered, and the importance of mobile-first development and responsive design in creating a mobile-exclusive promotional game for Acme Inc.

By the end of this exercise, participants will have gained practical experience in HTML DOM manipulation, CSS media queries, mobile-first development principles, and JavaScript event listeners while delivering an engaging mobile-only clicker game to promote Acme Inc.'s latest product, "Hand Crank+."
